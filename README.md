# .dotfiles
Collection of dotfiles and other configurations which I use in my Linux development VMs.

## Overview

My environment consists of the folowing:

- zsh shell
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) ZSH configuration and enhancements
- [Nerd Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com/)
- [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) - Beautification of the `ls` command, and includes [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons -- pairs well with Nerd Fonts
- [Spaceship ZSH theme](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/) - with minor tweaks
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Warning
This repository is for my own version control purposes, and made public for educational purposes only. 

There are a ton of aliases, path exports, and other configurations which will likely (at best) **not work** and at worst entirely mess up your installed shell. Use the contents of this repository **cautiously**.
